Actors have a race, attributes, skills.
Races have base attributes and skills.
Items have passive (equipped) and active (in use) bonuses (e.g., a mace might do damage (active), have a stun % (active), and give other passive bonuses while equiped.
All actions are resisted (e.g., attacking someone compares attack value (total skill) vs defense value (total skill) using:
r**2.5 / (r**2.5+1), r = ratio of actor/target
Performing an action earns an experience point, which is divvied up according to contributing factor (attributes and skills)
Attributes should increase much more slowly than skills
Attributes and skills should increase as something like the sqrt of experience.
Injuries and fatigue should reduce performance.

Attributes should each have multiple effects.

Strength
  carry capacity (and how much any particular load/physical action fatigues)
  damage
  other strength resistance rolls
  intimidation of npc's
Dexterity
  ability to land a blow accurately
#  ability to land critical hits (bypassing armor)
  ability to work with hands precisely (pickpocketing, crafting, ...)
Agility
  speed of attacks
  action initiative
  attack avoidance (dodging)
  run speed
Fortitude
  Physical ability to heal
  natural damage resistance.
  ability to keep going physically while exerting (directly affects 'stamina')
Willpower
  ability to keep going mentally while exerting (particularly magic) (this is as close as we get to 'mana')
  ability to resist mental effects
  stick-to-it-ness (for tasks requiring extended focus)
Cognition
  ability to learn skills (not attributes)
  ability to understand dieties
Charisma
  Leadership - improves friendlies success chances in all situations (if in leadership role)
  ability to affect npc's positively
Perception
  keenness of senses
  ability to perceive combat openings (trigger critical hits)
  ability to understand dieties
  ability to affect npc's positively
  ability to identify items


critical hits:
  # multiplies damage and reduces the effectiveness of damage resistance (armor, etc)
  if blow_lands
    damage = compute_damage()
    if perceice_opening
      multiplier = 1 + Random.rand * 2 # a Float 1.0-3.0
      dr_multiplier = 0.5 + Random.rand(0.5)
    else
      multiplier = 1.0
      dr_multiplier = 1.0
    end
    damage = damage * multiplier * (1 - dr * dr_multiplier)
  end
